# TODO

<!-- template:start -->
Decided for the template, not built yet; each arrives as its own change when it is needed.

- A CI step that publishes the images: the registry is project-specific (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds and smoke-tests them, nothing more).
- TanStack Router with typed routes arrives with the second screen: a link to a missing route or a wrong param becomes a compile error.

## When the first spec's criteria need a strength check

`criteria.sh` sees that a guardrail names a criterion, not that it would fail. The report that
measures it: run `just mutate` (Stryker.NET), read its JSON report (each mutant's `coveredBy` and
`killedBy` test ids), and count per `AC-<feature>-<n>` the mutants under the tests whose `Trait`
names it and how many survived. Stryker's `test-case-filter` does not work with the xUnit v3 runner
on Microsoft Testing Platform, so it reads a full run instead of running one criterion's tests.
First check that the `mtp` runner fills `coveredBy` per test.

## When the first fake of an outside service appears

The first fake in tests (WireMock for an external API, a mail catcher, e2e seed data) brings a
`test-environment/` folder with its own compose file, scripts and `.just/test-environment.just`;
`db.sh` moves there. Until then the gate needs only the one PostgreSQL container from `db.sh`.
